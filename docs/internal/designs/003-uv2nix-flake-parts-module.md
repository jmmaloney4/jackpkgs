# ADR-003: uv2nix Flake-Parts Module

## Status

Superseded

## Decision

This ADR captured the earliest design notes for the uv2nix-backed flake-parts module. It has been replaced by [ADR-003: Python (uv2nix) Flake-Parts Module](./003-python-flake-parts-module.md), which reflects the finalized interface and should be treated as the authoritative source.

## Notes

- Keep this stub for historical numbering continuity.
- Future updates must go into the Python ADR linked above.
